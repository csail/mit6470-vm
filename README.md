# MIT 6.470 Development VM

Step-by-step instructions for building and using the VM image given out to MIT
6.470 students.


## Using the VM image

If you downloaded the MIT 6.470 development VM image and want to learn how to
set up your computer to use it efficiently, go to the `using/` directory.


## Building the VM image

The `building/` directory contains the exact steps that we used to build the
MIT 6.470 development VM. You can use the information there to learn how to set
up your own server (the steps are largely the same), or to debug our setup
process and contribute patches.


## Issues

If you run into problems while using the MIT 6.470 development VM, please open
a issue on the project's GitHub page. This helps us address your problem as
quickly as possible, and might help other people running into the same problem.

Please do not use other avenues such as Stack Overflow or Twitter to ask
questions. Most importantly, please do not e-mail the MIT 6.470 staff directly.
